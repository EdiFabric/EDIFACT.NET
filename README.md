# EdiFabric C# .NET Examples for EDIFACT D96A, EANCOM D03B, IATA PADIS, and eDIGAS

## 1. Overview
EdiFabric is a software development kit for .NET Framework and .NET Core, which makes it straightforward to parse, generate, validate, acknowledge, split, customize, or in other words, to programmatically manipulate EDI files. It is written in C# and is distributed as a DLL file and a NuGet package.  

It currently supports all message types for the X12, EDIFACT, HL7, and NCPDP EDI standards, the German automotive standard VDA, as well as custom formatted flat files (delimited, positional, or a mixture of both).  

> NOTE: EdiFabric does not provide any communication components (AS2 or SFTP, for example), has no dashboard or UI, and is not a full end-to-end EDI solution.
The best option to get the gist of what EdiFabric is, and can do, is to play around with the trial and examples.  

The examples are organized into different projects in two logical categories: by product feature and by message type.   

```C#
var ediStream = File.OpenRead(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() + @"\..\..\..\Files\Edifact\PurchaseOrder.txt");

List<IEdiItem> ediItems;
using (var ediReader = new EdifactReader(ediStream, "EdiFabric.Templates.Edifact"))
    ediItems = ediReader.ReadToEnd().ToList();

var transactions = ediItems.OfType<TSORDERS>();
```

## 2. Requirements
- Visual Studio, compatible with the supported .NET versions. [Download Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
- Minimum .NET Framework 4.8 or .NET 6. Downgrading to .NET Framework 4.5 is possible by changing the target framework for each project.

## 3. Serial Key and EdiFabric trial DLLs
All projects reference EdiFabric EDI Tools as NuGet packages from nuget.org. If you wish to install EdiFabric EDI Tools as DLLs, download the trial DLLs from [here](https://sowl.co/oApEt).

## 4. Setup
Rebuild the solution with Package Restore enabled. If there are any build errors, manually install the missing packages from [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=edifabric).

## 5. Getting started
To get started, set project EdiFabric.Examples.EDIFACT.Demo as the startup project, open Program.cs and follow the instructions there. This project allows you to quickly translate your own EDI files.

## 6. Examples by feature
Explore the different features of EdiFabric, such as translating from EDI file (ReadEDI), generating EDI file (WriteEDI), validating EDI transactions (ValidateEDI), import/export from/to JSON , XML, CSV, create/save/query database (DB), generate CONTRL acknowledgments (AcknowledgeEDI) and how to map to/from an EDI template using Automapper and XSLT (MapEDI).  

## 7. Examples by message type
Explore how to translate from and generate several of the most popular EDIFACT transactions. The following examples are included; please let us know if you need a different one:  

EANCOM INVOIC Syntax 3  
SMDG BAPLIE  
US Customs CUSCAR

> **If you need to test with a message type in a different version, [install the templates for that version from EdiNation](https://support.edifabric.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016750838-How-to-start-a-new-VS-project).**

## 8. EDI Validation
All templates in EdiFabric.Templates.Edifact and EdiFabric.Templates.Padis can be used for validation.   

## 9. EDI Templates
EdiFabric supports all EDIFACT/EANCOM/IATA versions and message types. We have an extensive library of EDI templates, however, if you can't find a particular transaction, please let us know.   
The following templates are available out-of-the-box:
